<h1>Coverage Counters</h1>

<p>
  JaCoCo uses a set of different counters to calculate coverage metrics. The
  foundation of all counters are so called <i>basic blocks</i>. All other
  counters are derived from the <i>basic block</i> coverage information. While
  JaCoCo counters appear to be closely related to Java source code they are
  actually only derived from Java class files. In cases where the Java compiler
  creates so called <i>synthetic</i> code to reflect certain Java language
  constructs counters may therefore show unexpected results.   
</p>

<h2>Basic Blocks</h2>

<p>
  Basic blocks &ndash; mostly just referred to as <i>blocks</i> in the APIs and
  reports &ndash; are consecutive sequences of byte code instructions that will
  normally only executed on-block. The boundaries between blocks are
</p>

<ul>
  <li>return instructions,</li>
  <li>throw instructions,</li>
  <li>(conditional) jump instructions and</li>
  <li>target labels referred from jump, try/catch or switch instructions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The JaCoCo instrumentation mechanism inserts a probe at the end of every
  block. When the probe gets executes the block can be considered as executed.
  Unfortunately the opposite does not hold true: Exceptions might interrupt a
  block somewhere in the middle and the probe will not get executed. This
  results in the major drawback of basic block based probes:
</p>

<p class="hint">
  Blocks that encounter an exception somewhere in the middle will be considered
  as not executed.  
</p>

<p>
  Beside this, basic block code coverage has been proven to work very
  efficiently even with huge applications under test. The reasons are that the
  blocks can be easily determined at instrumentation time. The amount of
  inserted probes offer a good tradeoff between runtime overhead and report
  granularity. And last but not least basic blocks can be determined even if the
  class files have not been compiled in debug mode and therefore do not contain
  any source line information. Therefore all coverage counters except the line
  counter will work also in this case and provide useful coverage information
  e.g. for binary third party libraries.  
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
  For each block the number of included byte code instructions can be easily
  determined. The instruction counter summarizes the number of single byte code
  instructions that belong to executed blocks. As blocks may have different
  lengths instructions represent the size of the blocks and can serve as a
  replacement when no line information is available. 
</p>

<h2>Lines</h2>

<p>
  For all class files that have been compiled in debug mode with source line
  information, coverage information for individual lines can be calculated from
  basic blocks. Each block may span one ore multiple lines of source code. On
  the other hand a single line of source my belong to multiple blocks. A source
  line is considered as executed when at least one block that includes this line
  has been executed.
</p>

<p>
  Due to the fact that a single line may belong to more that one block 
  <i>partial</i> coverage can happen if some of the blocks are executed while
  others are not. This is typically the case with boolean expressions. While
  partially coverage lines are counted as executed due to the definition in the
  previous paragraph, they are highlighted in yellow color in the coverage
  reports. 
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
  Each non-abstract method consists of at least one block. A method is
  considered as executed when at least one block has been executed. As JaCoCo
  works on byte code level also constructors and static initializers are counted
  as methods. Some of these methods may not have a direct correspondence in Java
  source code, like implicitly generated default constructors or initializers
  for constants.
</p>

<h2>Classes</h2>

<p>
  A class is considered as executed when at least one of its method has been
  executed. Note that JaCoCo considers constructors as well as static
  initializers as methods. As Java interface types may contain static
  initializers such interfaces are also considered as executable classes.
