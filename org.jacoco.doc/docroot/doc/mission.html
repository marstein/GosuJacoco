<h1>Mission</h1>

<p class="intro">
  JaCoCo should become the standard tool for instrumentation based code coverage
  in Java VM based environments. The focus is providing a lightweight, flexible
  and well documented library for integration with various build and development
  tools. 
</p>

<p>
  There are several open source coverage technologies for Java. While
  implementing the Eclipse plug-in <a href="http://www.eclemma.org/">EclEmma</a>
  the observation was that none of them are really designed for integration.
  Most of them are build for a particular tool (Ant tasks, command line, IDE
  plug-in) and do not offer a documented API that allows embedding in different
  contexts. One of the best and widely used available open source tools is
  <a href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/">EMMA</a>. While EclEmma is based on it
  the EMMA library is not actively maintained any more by the original author.
  Due to the lack of regression tests maintenance and feature additions will
  become very difficult.

  JaCoCo should become the standard tool for instrumentation based code coverage

  and well documented library for integration with various build and development
  tools. Ant tasks are provided as reference usage scenarios. Other tools like a
  ready to use Eclipse plug-in (future version of EclEmma) might follow.
