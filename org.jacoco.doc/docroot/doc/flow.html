<h1>Control Flow Analysis for Java Methods</h1>

<p style="font-weight:bold;">
  DRAFT - This document does not reflect the current JaCoCo implementation. 
</p>

<p class="hint">
  Implementing a coverage tool for branch coverage requires detailed analysis
  of the internal control flow of Java methods. Due to the architecture of
  JaCoCo this analysis needs to happen on compiled class files (bytecode).
  This document defines graph structures for control flow analysis of Java
  bytecode and discusses strategies for probe insertion.

<h2>Motivation and Requirements</h2>

  <li>Branch Coverage</li>

<h2>From Statement Coverage to Branch Coverage</h2>

<p>
  A 
  JaCoCo till version 0.4.x provides statement coverage  
  As as starting point 
  differnce between statement coverage and branch coverage.

<h2>The Control Flow Graph</h2>

  <li>Subsequent Instructions</li>

<h2>Probe Insertion</h2>

<p>
  Code coverage analysis is a runtime metric that provides execution details
  of the software under test. This requires detailed recording about the
  instructions (instruction coverage) that have been executed. For branch
  coverage also the outcome of decisions has to be recorded. In any case
  execution data is collected by so called probes:
</p>

<p class="hint">
  A <b>probe</b> is a sequence of bytecode instructions that can be inserted
  into a Java method. When the probe is executed, this fact is recorded and can
  be reported by the coverage runtime.
</p>

<p>
  The only purpose of the probe is to record that it has been executed at least
  once. The probe does not record the number of times it has been called or
  collect any timing information. The latter is out of scope for code coverage
  analysis and more in the objective of a performance analysis tool. Typically
  multiple probes needs to be inserted into each method, therefore probes needs
  to be identified. Also the probe implementation and the storage mechanism it
  depends on needs to be thread safe as multi-threaded execution is a common
  scenario for java applications (albeit not for plain unit tests). Probes must
  not have any side effects on the original code of the method. Also they should
  add minimal overhead.
</p>

<p>
  So to summarize the requirements for execution probes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Record execution</li>
  <li>Identification for different probes</li>
  <li>Thread safe</li>
  <li>No side effects on application code</li>
  <li>Minimal runtime overhead</li>
</ul>

<p>
  JaCoCo implements probes with a <code>boolean[]</code> array instance per
  class. Each probe corresponds to a entry in this array. Whenever the probe is
  executed the entry is set to <code>true</code> with the following four
  bytecode instructions:
</p>

<pre class="source">
ALOAD    probearray
xPUSH    probeid
ICONST_1
BASTORE
</pre>

<p>
  Note that this probe code is thread safe, does not modify the operand stack
  or modify local variables and is also thread safe. It does also not leave the
  method though an external call. The only prerequisite is that the probe array
  is available as a local variable. For this at the beginning of each method
  additional instrumentation code needs to be added to obtain the array instance
  associated with the belonging class. To avoid code duplication the
  initialization is delegated to a static private method
  <code>$jacocoinit()</code> which is added to every non-interface class.
</p>

<p>
  The size of the probe code above depends on the position of the probe array
  variable and the value of the probe identifier as different opcodes can be
  used. As calculated in the table below the overhead per probe ranges between 4
  and 7 bytes of additional bytecode: 
</p>

<table class="coverage">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Possible Opcodes</td>
      <td>Min. Size [bytes]</td>
      <td>Max. Size [bytes]</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td>Total:</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>7</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ALOAD_x</code>, <code>ALOAD</code> <sup>1</sup></td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ICONST_x</code>, <code>BIPUSH</code>, <code>SIPUSH</code>, <code>LDC</code>, <code>LDC_W</code> <sup>2</sup></td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ICONST_1</code></td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>BASTORE</code></td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  <sup>1</sup> The probe array is the first variable after the arguments.
  If the method arguments do not consume more that 3 slots the 1-byte opcode can
  be used.<br/>
  <sup>2</sup> 1-byte opcodes for ids 0 to 5, 2-byte opcode for ids up to 127,
  3-byte opcode for ids up to 32767. Ids values of 32768 or more require an
  additional constant pool entry. For normal class files it is very unlikely to
  require more than 32,000 probes.
