<h1>Control Flow Analysis for Java Methods</h1>

<p style="font-weight:bold;">
  DRAFT - This document does not reflect the current JaCoCo implementation. 
</p>

<p class="hint">
  Implementing a coverage tool that supports statement (C0) as well as branch
  coverage coverage (C1) requires detailed analysis of the internal control flow
  of Java methods. Due to the architecture of JaCoCo this analysis happens on
  compiled class files (bytecode). This document defines graph structures for 
  control flow analysis of Java bytecode and discusses strategies for probe
  insertion. Marc R. Hoffmann, November 2010
</p>

<h2>Control Flow Graphs for Java Bytecode</h2>

<p> 
  As an starting point we take the following example method that contains a
  single branching point:
</p>

<pre class="source lang-java">
<span class="nr">    1</span>public static void example() {
<span class="nr">    2</span>    a();
<span class="nr">    3</span>    if (cond()) {
<span class="nr">    4</span>        b();
<span class="nr">    5</span>    } else {
<span class="nr">    6</span>        c();
<span class="nr">    7</span>    }
<span class="nr">    8</span>    d();
<span class="nr">    9</span>}
</pre>

<p>
  A Java compiler will create the following bytecode from this example method.
  Java bytecode is a linear sequence of instructions. Control flow is
  implemented with <i>jump</i> instructions like the conditional
  <code>IFEQ</code> or the unconditional <code>GOTO</code> opcode. The jump
  targets are technically relative offsets to the target instruction. For better
  readability we use symbolic labels (<code>L1</code>, <code>L2</code>) instead
  (also the ASM API uses such symbolic labels):  
</p>

<pre class="source">
<span class="nr">     </span>public static example()V
<span class="nr">     </span>    INVOKESTATIC a()V
<span class="nr">     </span>    INVOKESTATIC cond()Z
<span class="nr">     </span>    IFEQ L1
<span class="nr">     </span>    INVOKESTATIC b()V
<span class="nr">     </span>    GOTO L2
<span class="nr">  L1:</span>    INVOKESTATIC c()V
<span class="nr">  L2:</span>    INVOKESTATIC d()V
<span class="nr">     </span>    RETURN
</pre>

<p>
  The possible control flow in the bytecode above can be represented by a graph.
  The nodes are byte code instruction, the edged of the graph represent the
  possible control flow between the instructions:

<h3>Flow Edges</h3>

<p>
  The control flow graph of a Java method defined by Java byte code may have
  the following Edges. Each edge connects a source instruction with a target
  instruction. In some cases the source instruction or the target instruction
  does not exist (virtual edges for method entry and exit) or cannot be
  exactly specified (exception handlers). 
</p>

      <td>Source</td>
      <td>Target</td>

<h2>Probe Insertion Strategy</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Probes are additional instructions that can be inserted between existing
      instructions. Probes record the fact that they have been executed. One can
      think probes are placed on edges of the control flow graph. Therefore if
      a probe has been executed we know that the corresponding edge has been
      visited.</li>
  <li>If a edge has been visited, we know that the source node of the this edge
      has been executed.</li>
  <li>If a node has been executed and the node is the target of only one edge
      we know that this edge has been visited.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  With this observations we only need probes at the following edges:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>At every EXIT.</li>
  <li>At every edge where the target instruction is the target of more than one
      edge.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The execution status of all other edges and instructions can be derived from
  the status of this probes by recursively applying the rules above. 
</p>

<h2>Coverage Analysis</h2>


<h2>Probe Implementation</h2>

<p>
  Code coverage analysis is a runtime metric that provides execution details
  of the software under test. This requires detailed recording about the
  instructions (instruction coverage) that have been executed. For branch
  coverage also the outcome of decisions has to be recorded. In any case
  execution data is collected by so called probes:
</p>

<p class="hint">
  A <b>probe</b> is a sequence of bytecode instructions that can be inserted
  into a Java method. When the probe is executed, this fact is recorded and can
  be reported by the coverage runtime.
</p>

<p>
  The only purpose of the probe is to record that it has been executed at least
  once. The probe does not record the number of times it has been called or
  collect any timing information. The latter is out of scope for code coverage
  analysis and more in the objective of a performance analysis tool. Typically
  multiple probes needs to be inserted into each method, therefore probes needs
  to be identified. Also the probe implementation and the storage mechanism it
  depends on needs to be thread safe as multi-threaded execution is a common
  scenario for java applications (albeit not for plain unit tests). Probes must
  not have any side effects on the original code of the method. Also they should
  add minimal overhead.
</p>

<p>
  So to summarize the requirements for execution probes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Record execution</li>
  <li>Identification for different probes</li>
  <li>Thread safe</li>
  <li>No side effects on application code</li>
  <li>Minimal runtime overhead</li>
</ul>

<p>
  JaCoCo implements probes with a <code>boolean[]</code> array instance per
  class. Each probe corresponds to a entry in this array. Whenever the probe is
  executed the entry is set to <code>true</code> with the following four
  bytecode instructions:
</p>

<pre class="source">
ALOAD    probearray
xPUSH    probeid
ICONST_1
BASTORE
</pre>

<p>
  Note that this probe code is thread safe, does not modify the operand stack
  or modify local variables and is also thread safe. It does also not leave the
  method though an external call. The only prerequisite is that the probe array
  is available as a local variable. For this at the beginning of each method
  additional instrumentation code needs to be added to obtain the array instance
  associated with the belonging class. To avoid code duplication the
  initialization is delegated to a static private method
  <code>$jacocoinit()</code> which is added to every non-interface class.
</p>

<p>
  The size of the probe code above depends on the position of the probe array
  variable and the value of the probe identifier as different opcodes can be
  used. As calculated in the table below the overhead per probe ranges between 4
  and 7 bytes of additional bytecode: 
</p>

<table class="coverage">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Possible Opcodes</td>
      <td>Min. Size [bytes]</td>
      <td>Max. Size [bytes]</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td>Total:</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>7</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ALOAD_x</code>, <code>ALOAD</code> <sup>1</sup></td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ICONST_x</code>, <code>BIPUSH</code>, <code>SIPUSH</code>, <code>LDC</code>, <code>LDC_W</code> <sup>2</sup></td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ICONST_1</code></td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>BASTORE</code></td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  <sup>1</sup> The probe array is the first variable after the arguments.
  If the method arguments do not consume more that 3 slots the 1-byte opcode can
  be used.<br/>
  <sup>2</sup> 1-byte opcodes for ids 0 to 5, 2-byte opcode for ids up to 127,
  3-byte opcode for ids up to 32767. Ids values of 32768 or more require an
  additional constant pool entry. For normal class files it is very unlikely to
  require more than 32,000 probes.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Limitation: Only proves that the probe itself has been executed,
      assumptions about the surrounding application code is interpolation</li>
  <li>Probe in every edge of the control flow graph</li>
  <li>Every exit path known (branch coverage)</li>
  <li>Block entry known (exceptions within blocks)</li>
</ul>
